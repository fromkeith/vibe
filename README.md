Vibe Go Server
==============


This is a port of the node-js server found here:
    https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol.

    > Vibe Protocol is a protocol based on web standards to provide reliable full duplex connection over HTTP and elegant patterns to write real-time web applications

This is still a WIP. However, it does pass the vibe server.js tests.

This port does not currently support web sockets.
